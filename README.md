I'm Henry Bravo, the engineer who turns AI ideas into working products.

After 14 years building everything from code to teams (junior â†’ CTO), I discovered something game-changing: using AI to accelerate AI product development.

While others spend months on "AI strategy" and PowerPoints, I deliver working MVPs that real users can actually test.

My method: 4 proven base components + AI-accelerated development = idea to production in 30 days max.

At Seika, I help B2B companies integrate real AI into their products. No consulting. No documents. Working code.

3 MVPs delivered in 2024. 100% in production. 0% abandoned.

Is your "AI strategy" still stuck in PowerPoints? Let's talk about real results.
